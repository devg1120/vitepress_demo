# What is software X?
This a full documentation of a '*Software X*' using Vitepress.

This template will help you build a basic  costumizable Vitepress documentation static site for your Software.


## Motivation
I had the idea to make this software documentation website template after noticing that some of my friends and work colleagues are still using old fashioned ways in order to make simple software documentations, such as word/pdf, which is time-consuming for software engineers in case they wanted to edit/update the documentation. :tada:

## Why VitePress?
- Built on top of Vite, VitePress is a simple, powerful and fast static site generetor.

- VitePress can be used for making your own blogs or software/app documentations.

- You can use Vue 3 features in order to costumize your site.

- VuePress2 being built on top of webpack, makes it much more slower compared to VitePress when booting and hmr.

- Uses Vue 3 to reduce JS payload
